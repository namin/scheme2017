\section{Future work and Conclusion}
We have outlined a possible pipeline for extracting parallelism from a control-flow analysis in a principled way and have implemented GPU-based
and MPI-based transitive closure algorithms to experiment with parallizing this kind of problem. 
We are also interested in writing PGAS based backends for our RA kernels.
Partitioned global address space (PGAS) is a commonly used parallel programming model, 
that follows the ideals of shared memory access but operates in a distributed setting---it assumes a
global memory address space that is logically partitioned, portions of which are local to each process. 
The two main implementations of this programming model are chapel~\cite{doi:10.1177/1094342007078442} and UPC++.%~\cite{6877339}.
